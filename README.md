# Data-Analysis-to-Solve-Supply-Chain-issue-using-Power-BI

**Problem Statement:**

The primary issue is suspected to be delayed and incomplete deliveries over an extended period. Before expanding to other cities, the company wants to resolve these issues by closely tracking delivery performance.

The Supply Chain Analytics Team has decided to implement a standard OTIF (On-Time In-Full) service level measurement to monitor and improve customer order fulfillment on a daily basis.


**Key Metrics Analyzed:**

1.	On-Time Delivery (OT) %: The percentage of customer orders delivered on or before the promised date.
   
2.	In-Full Delivery (IF) %: The percentage of orders that were delivered in full without missing any items.
   
3.	On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %: The percentage of customer orders that were both on time and in full.
	
4.	Target vs. Actual Service Level: A comparison of the service levels achieved against predefined targets for each customer.
	
5.	Customer-Specific Performance: OTIF breakdown by customer to identify at-risk accounts.
	
6.	City-Wise Performance: OTIF analysis across Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara to identify location-specific bottlenecks.


**Analysis Approach:**

1. Daily Monitoring Dashboard:

An interactive Power BI dashboard will visualize OT, IF, and OTIF performance daily.

Filters for customer-wise, product-wise, and city-wise tracking.

Trend analysis to identify recurring service issues.

2. Comparative Performance Analysis:

Benchmark OTIF % against the target service level per customer.

Identify underperforming delivery regions or customer accounts.

Track delivery inconsistencies to predict and prevent contract losses.

3. Root Cause Analysis:

Evaluate product categories with the highest In-Full failure rates.

Assess logistics efficiency in different cities to determine delivery delays.

Monitor seasonal trends affecting service levels.
